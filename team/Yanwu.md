Hello, My name is Yanwu Tong and I am majored in computer science. I am a second year student in UCSB

some ideas:

the basice work of gold-scheduler can do is to allow users create time table for classes that they select for the next quarter. 

users will have access to know all information of the classes that will open in the next quarter may includes time of lectures.
time conflict should be point out and allow user to choose which they want to take.
